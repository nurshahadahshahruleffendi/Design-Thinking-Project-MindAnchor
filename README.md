# Design Thinking Project: MindAnchor 📸

Date : 15 January 2026

I had a group presentation for my design thinking project, MindAnchor. I am very grateful to have completed this project because this project allowed me to dive deep into understanding the ADHD community. 

Through this project, I gained knowledge about the daily challenges and struggles faced by ADHD students. I learned that fidgeting is actually a natural behavior. By developing MindAnchor, it has taught me the value of user-centered design, where we combined a physical focus regulation tool with a simple mobile app via Bluetooth to help users stay focused without the pressure of constant tracking. This experience has truly changed my perspective on how technology can work with human behavior. 

A huge thanks to my doctor and my team members for the great collaboration and support throughout every phase of the design thinking process.
